# xt - Translation Spec Build System

A tspec-based build system for comparing target triples and compile/linker commands across apps.

**Status:** Active - primary build system (replaced xtask).

## Usage

```bash
cargo xt build ex-x1-xt                     # Build with crate's tspec.ts.toml
cargo xt build ex-x1-xt -t tspec-expr.toml  # Build with alternative spec
cargo xt build ex-x2-xt -t tspec-opt.toml -r -s  # Build optimized, strip
cargo xt run ex-x1-xt                       # Build and run
cargo xt test ex-x2-xt                      # Build and test
cargo xt build ex-glibc                     # Works without tspec.ts.toml too
cargo xt build apps/ex-x2-xt                # Path to crate directory
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt -r                # Compare all tspec*.ts.toml
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt -t "*.ts.toml" -r # Compare with glob pattern
```

The `-t` flag is optional - use it to try alternative spec files without modifying `tspec.toml`.
Future: use `save_spec_snapshot` to create `tspec-001-abc123de.toml` variants.

## Design

See [notes/xt-design.md](../notes/xt-design.md) for full design documentation.
See [notes/xt-dev.md](../notes/xt-dev.md) for development notes and the linker flag scoping issue.

Key concepts:
- **App specs** - Apps define build requirements in `apps/<app>/tspec.ts.toml`
- **tspec.ts.toml is optional** - Crates without one get plain `cargo build/test`
- **Generated build.rs** - xt generates temporary build.rs for scoped linker flags

### How Linker Flags Work

xt generates a temporary `build.rs` to apply linker flags with binary-scoped directives:

```rust
// Generated by xt - deleted after build
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin=ex-x2-xt=-static");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin=ex-x2-xt=-nostdlib");
    // ...
}
```

This is necessary because RUSTFLAGS affects ALL compilations (including dependency
build scripts), causing crashes with flags like `-nostartfiles`. The generated
build.rs scopes flags to just the binary. See [notes/xt-dev.md](../notes/xt-dev.md)
for the full explanation.

### Spec Saving

Two save formats support different workflows:

- **`save_spec(spec, path)`** - Canonical specs with simple names (`rlibc-x1.toml`)
- **`save_spec_snapshot(spec, name, dir)`** - Iteration snapshots as `{name}-{seq:03}-{hash}.toml`

Snapshots allow quick experimentation with automatic breadcrumbs. Instead of
disciplined git commits to preserve each iteration, snapshots accumulate as
`rlibc-x1-001-abc123de.toml`, `rlibc-x1-002-def456gh.toml`, etc. The sequence
number enables chronological sorting; the hash identifies content.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -p xt              # run all xt tests
cargo test -p xt -- --nocapture  # see println output
cargo test -p xt spec_default    # run specific test
```

- Unit tests live alongside code in each module using `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- Integration tests in `tests/` use fixtures from `tests/data/`

## Development Plan

### Completed

1. ~~Create `types.rs` - Spec parameter enums~~ Done
2. ~~Create `tspec.rs` - Loading and resolving specs from TOML~~ Done
3. ~~Implement build command~~ Done
4. ~~Implement run command~~ Done
5. ~~Implement test command~~ Done
6. ~~Generated build.rs for scoped linker flags~~ Done
7. ~~Support target_triple in tspec.toml~~ Done
8. ~~Support `build_std` for nightly optimized builds~~ Done
9. ~~Support `version_script` for symbol visibility~~ Done
10. ~~Support `panic = "immediate-abort"` (nightly)~~ Done
11. ~~Strip flag (`-s`) for build and run commands~~ Done
12. ~~Compare command for spec comparison~~ Done
13. ~~Path resolution for crates and tspec files~~ Done

### Phase 1: Spec Comparison (feature parity with xtask) - Done

Compare specs to see size differences:

```bash
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt -r                # All tspec*.ts.toml in crate dir
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt -t "*.ts.toml" -r # Explicit glob pattern
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt -t a.toml -t b.toml -r  # Explicit file list
```

Output shows specs sorted by size (smallest first) with percent change from largest.

### Phase 2: Merge to Main - Done

1. ~~Create `xtask` branch from current main (preservation)~~
2. ~~Merge `xt-dev` to main~~
3. ~~Remove xtask crate~~
4. ~~Update CLAUDE.md with new commands~~

### Phase 3: Interactive tspec Management

Enable fast iteration without manual TOML editing:

```bash
cargo xt ts list                             # List all tspec files in workspace
cargo xt ts list ex-x2                       # List tspec files for a crate
cargo xt ts show ex-x2                       # Show all tspec contents for crate
cargo xt ts show ex-x2 -t tspec-opt          # Show specific tspec
cargo xt ts hash ex-x2                       # Show content hash (TODO)
cargo xt ts new myapp                        # Create minimal tspec.toml (TODO)
cargo xt ts add myapp --rustc build_std=std,core,panic_abort  # (TODO)
cargo xt ts remove myapp --rustc panic       # (TODO)
cargo xt ts diff tspec.toml tspec-opt.toml   # (TODO)
```

Note: `tspec` and `ts` are aliases for the same subcommand.

See [notes/interactive-tspec.md](../notes/interactive-tspec.md) for design details.
