# xt - Translation Spec Build System

A tspec-based build system for comparing target triples and compile/linker commands across apps.

**Status:** In development on `xt-dev` branch.

## Usage

```bash
cargo xt build ex-x1-xt                     # Build with crate's tspec.toml
cargo xt build ex-x1-xt -t tspec-expr.toml  # Build with alternative spec
cargo xt build ex-x2-xt -t tspec-opt.toml -r -s  # Build optimized, strip
cargo xt run ex-x1-xt                       # Build and run
cargo xt test ex-x2-xt                      # Build and test
cargo xt build ex-glibc                     # Works without tspec.toml too
cargo xt build apps/ex-x2-xt                # Path to crate directory
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt tspec.toml tspec-opt.toml -r  # Compare two specs
```

The `-t` flag is optional - use it to try alternative spec files without modifying `tspec.toml`.
Future: use `save_spec_snapshot` to create `tspec-001-abc123de.toml` variants.

## Design

See [notes/xt-design.md](../notes/xt-design.md) for full design documentation.
See [notes/xt-dev.md](../notes/xt-dev.md) for development notes and the linker flag scoping issue.

Key concepts:
- **App specs** - Apps define build requirements in `apps/<app>/tspec.toml`
- **tspec.toml is optional** - Crates without one get plain `cargo build/test`
- **Generated build.rs** - xt generates temporary build.rs for scoped linker flags

### How Linker Flags Work

xt generates a temporary `build.rs` to apply linker flags with binary-scoped directives:

```rust
// Generated by xt - deleted after build
fn main() {
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin=ex-x2-xt=-static");
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bin=ex-x2-xt=-nostdlib");
    // ...
}
```

This is necessary because RUSTFLAGS affects ALL compilations (including dependency
build scripts), causing crashes with flags like `-nostartfiles`. The generated
build.rs scopes flags to just the binary. See [notes/xt-dev.md](../notes/xt-dev.md)
for the full explanation.

### Spec Saving

Two save formats support different workflows:

- **`save_spec(spec, path)`** - Canonical specs with simple names (`rlibc-x1.toml`)
- **`save_spec_snapshot(spec, name, dir)`** - Iteration snapshots as `{name}-{seq:03}-{hash}.toml`

Snapshots allow quick experimentation with automatic breadcrumbs. Instead of
disciplined git commits to preserve each iteration, snapshots accumulate as
`rlibc-x1-001-abc123de.toml`, `rlibc-x1-002-def456gh.toml`, etc. The sequence
number enables chronological sorting; the hash identifies content.

## Testing

```bash
cargo test -p xt              # run all xt tests
cargo test -p xt -- --nocapture  # see println output
cargo test -p xt spec_default    # run specific test
```

- Unit tests live alongside code in each module using `#[cfg(test)]` blocks
- Integration tests in `tests/` use fixtures from `tests/data/`

## Development Plan

### Completed

1. ~~Create `types.rs` - Spec parameter enums~~ Done
2. ~~Create `tspec.rs` - Loading and resolving specs from TOML~~ Done
3. ~~Implement build command~~ Done
4. ~~Implement run command~~ Done
5. ~~Implement test command~~ Done
6. ~~Generated build.rs for scoped linker flags~~ Done
7. ~~Support target_triple in tspec.toml~~ Done
8. ~~Support `build_std` for nightly optimized builds~~ Done
9. ~~Support `version_script` for symbol visibility~~ Done
10. ~~Support `panic = "immediate-abort"` (nightly)~~ Done
11. ~~Strip flag (`-s`) for build and run commands~~ Done
12. ~~Compare command for spec comparison~~ Done
13. ~~Path resolution for crates and tspec files~~ Done

### Phase 1: Spec Comparison (feature parity with xtask) - Done

Compare two specs to see size difference and verify behavior:

```bash
cargo xt compare ex-x2-xt tspec.toml tspec-opt.toml -r
```

Output shows which spec produces smaller binary and verifies identical exit codes.

### Phase 2: Merge to Main

1. Create `xtask` branch from current main (preservation)
2. Merge `xt-dev` to main
3. Remove xtask crate
4. Update CLAUDE.md with new commands

### Phase 3: Interactive tspec Management

Enable fast iteration without manual TOML editing:

```bash
cargo xt tspec list                          # List all tspec files
cargo xt tspec show ex-x2-xt                 # Show resolved spec
cargo xt tspec new myapp                     # Create minimal tspec.toml
cargo xt tspec add myapp --rustc build_std=std,core,panic_abort
cargo xt tspec remove myapp --rustc panic
cargo xt tspec diff tspec.toml tspec-opt.toml
```

See [notes/interactive-tspec.md](../notes/interactive-tspec.md) for design details.
