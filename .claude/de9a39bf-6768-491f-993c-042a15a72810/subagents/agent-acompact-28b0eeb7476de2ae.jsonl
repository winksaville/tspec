User asked to implement a plan for adding `--manifest-path` flag with `--mp` alias to tspec.\n2. I started reading files and the user said \"stop\" because I jumped into code changes without following the workflow (updating chores and todo first).\n3. User asked me to update chores-6.md and todo.md first.\n4. I added the chore entry and updated todo.md.\n5. User reminded me this should be a -dev0 marker commit per the workflow.\n6. I created the feature branch `feat-manifest-path` and bumped version to `0.15.4-dev0`.\n7. User rejected my first commit message for being too long (\"Add --manifest-path plan, v0.15.4-dev0\" was too verbose, then accepted \"chore: --manifest-path plan, v0.15.4-dev0\").\n8. User asked me to add a body to the commit plus a link to the chore - I amended with the chore link.\n9. User noted URLs may break 50/72 rule but that's acceptable.\n10. User approved starting dev1 (refactor step).\n11. I implemented dev1: refactored `resolve_package_arg()`, `current_package_name()`, and `WorkspaceInfo::discover()` to accept `project_root`. Updated all callers.\n12. Had a formatting issue with `list_target_names` function signature - fixed it.\n13. Ran full verification (test, test-build, install, re-test, clippy, fmt).\n14. User had trouble seeing the commit due to garbled display - split into separate git add and git commit.\n15. Commit went through as `bc73328`.\n16. User asked to do dev2.\n17. I bumped version to `0.15.4-dev2` and started implementing:\n    - Added `--manifest-path` flag to `cli.rs`\n    - Added `resolve_manifest_path()` to `find_paths.rs`\n    - Updated `main.rs` to use `resolve_manifest_path` when `--manifest-path` is provided\n18. Tests passed but smoke test from /tmp failed - `cargo_build.rs` still called `find_project_root()` internally.\n19. I discovered `run_cargo()`, `build_package()`, `test_package()`, `plain_cargo_build_release()` in `cargo_build.rs` all needed `project_root` threaded through.\n20. Also `compare.rs`'s `compare_specs()`, `build_baseline()`, `build_spec()` needed updating.\n21. Also `all.rs` functions needed updating to pass `workspace.root` to `build_package`/`test_package`.\n22. Made all the changes, but then had issues:\n    - Formatting issues (many long lines from extra parameter)\n    - Ran `tspec fmt` to auto-fix\n    - Clippy warnings about needless borrows (`&workspace` when `workspace` is already `&Path`)\n    - Fixed by removing `let workspace = project_root` alias and using `project_root` directly\n    - But this broke test code that had `let workspace = PathBuf::from(...)` and used `&workspace`\n    - Had to selectively fix: replace `&workspace` with `project_root` in `run_cargo()` body, but keep `&workspace` in tests and in `apply_spec_to_command` which has its own `workspace` parameter\n    - Also had to fix `apply_spec_to_command` body where global replace incorrectly changed `workspace.join(\"target\")` to `project_root.join(\"target\")`\n\nCurrent state: I was in the middle of fixing the `cargo_build.rs` replacements when the summary was requested. The file still may have issues from the global replacements. I haven't yet re-run tests/clippy/fmt to verify the current state compiles.\n\nKey files modified:\n- `Cargo.toml` - version bump to 0.15.4-dev2\n- `src/cli.rs` - added `manifest_path` field\n- `src/find_paths.rs` - added `resolve_manifest_path()` function\n- `src/main.rs` - compute `project_root` from `--manifest-path` or `find_project_root()`\n- `src/cargo_build.rs` - thread `project_root` through `run_cargo`, `build_package`, `test_package`, `plain_cargo_build_release`\n- `src/compare.rs` - thread `project_root` through `compare_specs`, `build_baseline`, `build_spec`\n- `src/all.rs` - pass `workspace.root` to `build_package`/`test_package`/`compare_specs`\n- `src/cmd/build.rs`, `run.rs`, `test.rs`, `compare.rs` - pass `project_root` to `build_package`/`test_package`\n- `src/workspace.rs` - `discover()` takes `project_root` (done in dev1)\n- `src/cmd/mod.rs` - `resolve_package_arg()` and `current_package_name()` take `project_root` (done in dev1)\n- Various ts_cmd files (done in dev1)\n- `notes/chores-6.md` - added chore entry\n- `notes/todo.md` - moved item to In Progress\n\nUser feedback patterns:\n- Always follow the workflow (chores, todo, version bumps, marker commits)\n- Keep commits concise with bodies and chore links\n- 50/72 rule (URLs are exceptions)\n- Don't commit with approval prompts (the garbled display issue)\n- Split long git commands into separate add and commit\n- Reinstall and re-test with new binary as part of verification\n</analysis>\n\n<summary>\n1. Primary Request and Intent:\n   The user asked to implement a `--manifest-path` flag with `--mp` alias for tspec, following a detailed plan. The plan has two steps:\n   - **dev1**: Refactor `resolve_package_arg()`, `current_package_name()`, and `WorkspaceInfo::discover()` to accept `project_root` as a parameter instead of deriving it from cwd. No behavior change.\n   - **dev2**: Add `--manifest-path` / `--mp` global flag to CLI, add `resolve_manifest_path()` to `find_paths.rs`, and wire into `main.rs`.\n   \n   The user emphasized following the project's workflow: update chores/todo notes, create feature branch, marker commit, version bumps, full verification after changes, install immediately, re-test with new binary.\n\n2. Key Technical Concepts:\n   - tspec is a spec-driven build system wrapper for Rust/cargo\n   - `project_root` is computed in `main.rs` via `find_project_root()` and passed to commands\n   - Three helpers previously re-derived project_root from cwd: `resolve_package_arg()`, `current_package_name()`, `WorkspaceInfo::discover()`\n   - Additionally discovered `run_cargo()`, `build_package()`, `test_package()`, `plain_cargo_build_release()` in `cargo_build.rs` also called `find_project_root()` internally\n   - `compare_specs()` chain in `compare.rs` also needed threading\n   - `all.rs` batch operations use `workspace.root` to pass to build/test functions\n   - Feature workflow: branch creation, `-dev0` marker commit, `-devN` code commits, verification workflow, chore notes\n   - Commit conventions: 50/72 rule (URLs exempt), concise bodies, chore links, `Co-Authored-By` trailer\n\n3. Files and Code Sections:\n\n   - **`Cargo.toml`** - Version bumped from `0.15.3` → `0.15.4-dev0` → `0.15.4-dev1` → `0.15.4-dev2`\n\n   - **`notes/chores-6.md`** - Added new chore entry for the feature:\n     ```\n     ## 20260223 - Add --manifest-path flag with --mp alias\n     ### Problem / ### Approach / ### Plan (multi-step) / ### Status\n     ```\n\n   - **`notes/todo.md`** - Moved `--manifest-path` item from Todo to In Progress as `[42]`\n\n   - **`src/cli.rs`** - Added `manifest_path` field to `Cli` struct:\n     ```rust\n     /// Path to Cargo.toml or directory containing one\n     #[arg(\n         long = \"manifest-path\",\n         visible_alias = \"mp\",\n         global = true,\n         value_name = \"PATH\"\n     )]\n     pub manifest_path: Option<PathBuf>,\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/find_paths.rs`** - Added `resolve_manifest_path()` function after `find_project_root()`:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn resolve_manifest_path(path: &Path) -> Result<PathBuf> {\n         let start_dir = if path.is_file() {\n             path.parent()\n                 .ok_or_else(|| anyhow::anyhow!(\"invalid manifest path: {}\", path.display()))?\n                 .to_path_buf()\n         } else if path.is_dir() {\n             path.to_path_buf()\n         } else {\n             bail!(\"path not found: {}\", path.display());\n         };\n         if !start_dir.join(\"Cargo.toml\").exists() {\n             bail!(\"no Cargo.toml found at {}\", start_dir.display());\n         }\n         // Walk up to find workspace root, same logic as find_project_root()\n         let mut dir = start_dir.clone();\n         let mut package_root: Option<PathBuf> = None;\n         loop {\n             let cargo_toml = dir.join(\"Cargo.toml\");\n             if cargo_toml.exists() {\n                 let content = std::fs::read_to_string(&cargo_toml)?;\n                 if has_toml_section_exact(&content, \"workspace\") {\n                     if let Some(ref pkg_root) = package_root\n                         && is_excluded_from_workspace(&content, &dir, pkg_root)\n                     { return Ok(pkg_root.clone()); }\n                     return Ok(dir);\n                 }\n                 if package_root.is_none() && has_toml_section_exact(&content, \"package\") {\n                     package_root = Some(dir.clone());\n                 }\n             }\n             if !dir.pop() {\n                 if let Some(root) = package_root { return Ok(root); }\n                 bail!(\"no project root found from {}\", start_dir.display());\n             }\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/main.rs`** - Rewrote to compute `project_root` once and pass to all commands:\n     ```rust\n     use tspec::find_paths::{find_project_root, resolve_manifest_path};\n     // ...\n     let project_root = match cli.manifest_path {\n         Some(ref path) => resolve_manifest_path(path)?,\n         None => find_project_root()?,\n     };\n     // All commands now use &project_root instead of &find_project_root()?\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/cmd/mod.rs`** - (dev1) Changed signatures:\n     ```rust\n     pub(crate) fn resolve_package_arg(pkg: &str, project_root: &Path) -> Result<Option<String>>\n     pub(crate) fn current_package_name(project_root: &Path) -> Option<String>\n     ```\n     `current_package_name` also added: `if !cwd.starts_with(project_root) { return None; }`\n\n   - **`src/workspace.rs`** - (dev1) Changed signature:\n     ```rust\n     pub fn discover(project_root: &Path) -> Result<Self> {\n         let metadata = MetadataCommand::new()\n             .manifest_path(project_root.join(\"Cargo.toml\"))\n             .no_deps().exec()...\n     ```\n\n   - **`src/cargo_build.rs`** - (dev2) Major changes threading `project_root`:\n     - `run_cargo()` now takes `project_root: &Path` parameter, removed `let workspace = find_project_root()?`\n     - Removed `find_project_root` from imports\n     - All internal `workspace` references in `run_cargo` changed to `project_root`\n     - `build_package()`, `test_package()`, `plain_cargo_build_release()` all take `project_root: &Path`\n     - **CAUTION**: Global replace of `&workspace` → `project_root` and `workspace.join(\"target\")` → `project_root.join(\"target\")` accidentally affected `apply_spec_to_command()` body which has its own `workspace` parameter. Partially fixed but may still have issues.\n\n   - **`src/compare.rs`** - (dev2) `compare_specs()`, `build_baseline()`, `build_spec()` all take `project_root: &Path`\n\n   - **`src/all.rs`** - (dev2) Passes `&workspace.root` to `build_package`, `test_package`, `compare_specs`\n\n   - **`src/cmd/build.rs`**, **`run.rs`**, **`test.rs`**, **`compare.rs`** - Pass `project_root` to `build_package`/`test_package`/`compare_specs` calls\n\n   - **`src/cmd/clean.rs`**, **`clippy.rs`**, **`fmt.rs`** - (dev1) Pass `project_root` to `resolve_package_arg`\n\n   - **`src/ts_cmd/show.rs`**, **`list.rs`**, **`hash.rs`** - (dev1) Pass `project_root` to `WorkspaceInfo::discover`\n\n4. Errors and fixes:\n   - **Skipped workflow steps**: User stopped me from coding before updating chores/todo. Fixed by adding chore entry and todo update first.\n   - **Missing -dev0 marker commit**: User reminded me. Fixed by creating feature branch and marker commit.\n   - **Commit message too verbose**: First attempt had \"Add --manifest-path plan\" - user wanted conciser. Used \"chore: --manifest-path plan, v0.15.4-dev0\".\n   - **Missing commit body/chore link**: User asked for body with link. Amended commit.\n   - **Formatting issue (dev1)**: `list_target_names` function signature too long for one line. Fixed by breaking into multi-line.\n   - **Garbled commit display**: Long `git add && git commit` one-liner rendered badly in terminal. Fixed by splitting into separate `git add` and `git commit` calls.\n   - **Smoke test failure (dev2)**: `cd /tmp && tspec build --mp /path` failed with \"could not find project root\". Root cause: `cargo_build.rs::run_cargo()` still called `find_project_root()` internally. Fixed by threading `project_root` through `run_cargo`, `build_package`, `test_package`, `plain_cargo_build_release`, and their callers in `all.rs`, `compare.rs`, and command files.\n   - **Clippy needless_borrow warnings**: After changing `let workspace = project_root` (making workspace `&Path`), `&workspace` became `&&Path`. Fixed by removing the alias and using `project_root` directly.\n   - **Global replace collateral damage**: `replace_all` of `&workspace` → `project_root` and `workspace.join(\"target\")` → `project_root.join(\"target\")` hit code in `apply_spec_to_command()` (which has its own `workspace` parameter) and test code (which defines `let workspace = PathBuf::from(...)`). Partially fixed by reverting test changes and `apply_spec_to_command` body changes.\n\n5. Problem Solving:\n   - **dev1 completed successfully**: Pure refactor threading `project_root` through `resolve_package_arg`, `current_package_name`, `WorkspaceInfo::discover` and all callers. All 274 unit tests + 16 integration tests pass. Committed as `bc73328`.\n   - **dev2 in progress**: The `--manifest-path` flag is added to CLI, `resolve_manifest_path()` is implemented, `main.rs` is wired up. The deeper `cargo_build.rs` chain has been refactored but the global string replacements caused collateral damage in `apply_spec_to_command()` body and test code. The fixes are partially applied — need to verify compilation, run tests, clippy, fmt.\n\n6.

Pending Tasks:\n   - Complete dev2: fix remaining `cargo_build.rs` issues from global replacements\n   - Run full verification: `tspec test -p tspec`, `tspec test -p tspec-build`, `tspec install --path .`, re-test with new binary, `tspec clippy`, `tspec fmt --check`\n   - Run manual smoke tests: `cd /tmp && tspec build --mp /path/to/tspec`, `--mp` with Cargo.toml path, `--mp` with `-p` flag\n   - Commit dev2\n   - Eventually: remove `-dev` from version, update chores status, move todo item to Done\n\n8. Current Work:\n   Working on dev2 of the `--manifest-path` feature. I had just finished fixing collateral damage from global string replacements in `cargo_build.rs`. Specifically, I:\n   - Replaced `let workspace = project_root` with direct `project_root` usage in `run_cargo()`\n   - Used `replace_all` to change `workspace.join(\"target\")` → `project_root.join(\"target\")` and `&workspace` → `project_root` globally in `cargo_build.rs`\n   - This accidentally changed code in `apply_spec_to_command()` (which has its own `workspace` parameter) and test code\n   - Fixed test code: reverted `apply_spec_to_command(&mut cmd, &spec, project_root, ...)` back to `&workspace` in tests\n   - Fixed `apply_spec_to_command` body: reverted `project_root.join(\"target\")` back to `workspace.join(\"target\")` at line 531 and lines 612-613\n   \n   The code has NOT yet been verified to compile. Need to run tests, clippy, fmt, install, smoke tests.\n\n9. Optional Next Step:\n   Run `tspec test -p tspec` to verify `cargo_build.rs` compiles correctly after the global replacements and fixes. If there are remaining compilation errors from the `&workspace` → `project_root` replacement, fix them. Then continue the full verification workflow: test both packages, install, re-test, clippy, fmt, smoke tests, then commit.\n   \n   User's request: \"ok now do dev2\" — dev2 implementation is mostly done but needs verification and commit.\n</summary>"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1706,"cache_read_input_tokens":166666,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1706},"output_tokens":6,"service_tier":"standard","inference_geo":"not_available"}},"requestId":"req_011CYRZQmagBif5f2EBn2EEo","type":"assistant","uuid":"647c53d0-530f-450a-bd03-32e74aee8f23","timestamp":"2026-02-23T19:35:04.480Z"}
