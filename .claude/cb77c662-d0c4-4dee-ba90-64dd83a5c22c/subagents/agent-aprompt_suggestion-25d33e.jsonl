I installed it and told them they can test it in rlibc-x.\n\nThe natural next step is for the user to test it themselves in rlibc-x. After that testing, they would come back and say something like \"it works\" or \"works\" or \"good\" and then want to commit.\n\nBut right now, they need to go test it. I shouldn't suggest anything because they need to do manual testing and come back with results. Or they might say \"it works, commit it\" or similar.\n\nActually, the most natural thing would be for them to report back after testing. I should stay silent and let them test.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":141001,"cache_read_input_tokens":17483,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":141001},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkKE6FVgbu6HY1VzRpfs","type":"assistant","uuid":"f7d84b78-4627-48e4-bd00-3b477ea6b1df","timestamp":"2026-02-03T02:04:24.198Z"}
