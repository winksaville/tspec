User wanted to make POP support and package rename changes\n2. Changes are complete and building\n3. User asked about `crate::` vs `tspec::` - I explained why `tspec::` is needed\n4. The conversation was about whether to do one or two commits\n\nThe natural next step would be to proceed with committing. Given the explanation about the commits being interleaved, the user would likely accept a single commit. They might say something like:\n\n- \"ok let's just do one commit\"\n- \"one commit then\"\n- \"ok commit it\"\n\nThe user seems to prefer brief, direct messages. They've been asking technical clarifying questions and then moving forward.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":885,"cache_read_input_tokens":99392,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":885},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkChhHqEkJXYoTwh9t4N","type":"assistant","uuid":"05f471fc-1e37-43c1-ac12-175ede4ebe15","timestamp":"2026-02-03T00:38:51.439Z"}
