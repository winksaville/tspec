User wanted to make changes\n2. We made POP support changes and package rename changes\n3. I just asked them what their preference is for committing - one combined commit or using git add -p for two separate commits\n\nThe user originally said they wanted two commits (\"I'm thinking two commits\"), but then I pointed out the changes are interleaved and offered options. Given the user's original preference for two commits but the complexity of splitting them, they'd likely just go with the simpler option now.\n\nLooking at their style - they tend to be direct and practical. Since splitting is complex and I offered \"one combined commit\" as the simpler option, they'd probably just say something like:\n\n\"one commit is fine\" or \"let's just do one commit\" or \"combined commit\"\n\nOr they might just say \"go ahead\" meaning proceed with the simpler option.","signature":"EpIICkYICxgCKkAk//4eY7UyjHyRr7y/RMLg/cl8nOkqqEnrmxaevZbJStNH1JrgtAudxKl9eFqJLTLc7hrOvzwSh1mf4QR4F2LgEgyif28x1EdZpSvi/VwaDGNCqL9VKzwUNoaDRCIwHw5ChKxUIPwPpLxuWx0hBZOxtcquK4T2AWZowQtlHVoO2BtusqJNIijmyCWlk21oKvkGzGveW712/ZH/oBeGhR28YVmHg+9UXXXAvvRulwelEWNAs0CaYGZo2ahvS4jeVDtbYrpOyAWgRMS/G6MjTaj4ht3g37KXLg6ct1ZgxiJqlrfV7nZBfgvK+lW5h4kr9VQzXZtwzRz652ot6A8JyFqNTdsHrhKldx8nSWIVNeINKXVcJ0povMPmXYm/FITqwYPME35UooKkG+fQViWqjitpFxZZ71oj6/3TvGHwCgrmSn5O1Ueigev43p9nINB8ZmdXlkipvVb1Uz0QkvNdg2s4bDerLomUnDaIjdCeB5/UOvi6YC6BJXmdxF2FuMKqupVFpBcXUWhn0snDYaYzaCL8h/tPGlQxn26f1DOZOQgKrUAeFiHE4e57GlJFCCBqkOET0OmpFe26obJ85CtY+FV/unODPXaA/gu5vj0PK6efqYj3KV80NA/yaSUPimWKzs2JBlD1/UN96Vc6hScPTy7HRLjdIbAXNFPABVkZdW6CoEtvv3uoKUpDXqWY5OooeirgSlIA7yvbbwEQeQT2FZSXh/a7hNLssisRiOB1Hy76LYUje8uJ1ENPMCLw3wUp3Tke3g1focj3tBgSdp9yPvxJNbcYkeE2Hke7NXZD1yJA25j3SDBKFnkiDZukNoandLTuCBTbfa51xVnD7112/+SZAPluPwQt2EWjaG1hdkro/t1qIADMz6nxuL4wVxtElOQ+9t/x6/pOQUMfIqsIrM+08XqPoUbU3rYzi3Ql5SbNzbCdz5enEKkdjRXeN40J9p66VJ3buPdZi7FxS4goWPlGdT3NDfCXtHDKQqRDi7RZsr9DaWw2zbqo+AJZCJd85VELHhaAN0V4Ef5vCDWJgz9M5VqB3OOhu3TwwdOLJKUMRF4NUEl4e60TQaFaLhPgZcGWtU0HqFY2LvZ8YnrwggoOV9JTDqnAmTCRX4YPY4GZGjABul3HQE5TaT+Rn5jqF3GpTVLSKszGHLjAppZQs9uvO6Tp3FH6CF7hYajoRYGnngDws5RQnKA0ZVevF2zICtC9GbD0R8/ARu3I2eQtLOMgUF1dtg1j2+CMPT0jpdQnuDNockEszdfhhYimHa1mx8aW7ePXQOP5rDmwWN/MMNATMsGBzA4zKh9EkB4eHSAR2eS9btFjucXlabQuYB4c/P/JiinNK7KTHOffiGDMXnrGf8IiQ/OdRANynRgB"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2240,"cache_read_input_tokens":97444,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2240},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkCcBYHgZ1cKM7RYBnRq","type":"assistant","uuid":"c15f6882-d1b5-4447-8330-32fd9f6f52ea","timestamp":"2026-02-03T00:37:35.914Z"}
