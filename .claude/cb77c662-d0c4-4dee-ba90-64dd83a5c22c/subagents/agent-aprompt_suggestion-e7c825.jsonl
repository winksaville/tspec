They've migrated the history, they're cleaning up. The obvious next steps would be:\n1. Actually delete the branch (they might just do that themselves in terminal)\n2. Delete the xt directory from rlibc-x since they've moved it out\n3. Update rlibc-x's Cargo.toml to remove xt from workspace members\n\nGiven they said \"I can do that myself\" earlier about moving files, they're comfortable with basic git/file operations. But they might want help with the next logical step which is cleaning up rlibc-x - removing xt from the workspace.\n\nActually, the most natural thing would be to delete the xt-history branch - but they can do that themselves easily. \n\nThe bigger cleanup task is removing xt/ from rlibc-x entirely (the actual directory and workspace member). That's probably what they'd think about next.\n\nOr they might want to verify things are working in tspec first - like building/testing.\n\nGiven the flow, I think they might want to:\n- Remove xt from rlibc-x (both the directory and Cargo.toml entry)\n- Or test the new tspec repo works\n\n\"remove xt from rlibc-x\" or \"now remove xt/ from rlibc-x\" seems likely.\n\nOr they might just proceed to delete the branch and move on. If the next step isn't super obvious, I should stay silent.\n\nActually the user asked about removing the branch, I said yes. They'll probably just do it. The next natural step after cleanup would be either testing tspec works, or removing xt/ from rlibc-x entirely.\n\nI'll suggest something about removing xt from rlibc-x since that's the logical continuation of the migration.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":449,"cache_read_input_tokens":32390,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":449},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXjp5w8TxMXi3eNErJYE7","type":"assistant","uuid":"d7252d83-abec-4746-a252-477ee2140543","timestamp":"2026-02-02T19:42:21.682Z"}
