I then explained that the changes are mixed in some files and offered 3 options.\n\nGiven the user's style throughout this conversation, they've been making decisive choices. When presented with options, they typically just pick one. They've been doing incremental commits and care about clean history.\n\nThe user originally wanted two commits but the changes got interleaved. Given the complexity I described with using git add -p, they might just accept option 2 (commit together) since option 1 is \"fiddly\" as I said.\n\nBut they specifically said \"I'd like to commit the xt -> tspec change first\" - so they do want to try to separate them. They might say something like \"let's try git add -p\" or just \"1\" to pick option 1.\n\nGiven their technical sophistication and desire for clean history, I think they'd try option 1.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2171,"cache_read_input_tokens":99985,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2171},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkCqbvMPorqxkPca1ahi","type":"assistant","uuid":"7fe07cc4-a305-4199-8a36-d9c9cd732812","timestamp":"2026-02-03T00:40:39.502Z"}
