The natural next step would be for them to actually do the amend\n\nThey might type something to execute that amend, or they might type \"push\" since the commit is ready and they just need to remember to amend before pushing.\n\nGiven the context - they have a commit ready, they want to amend .claude files into it - the most natural next action would be to do the amend and then push.\n\nThe user's style is very terse - single words or short phrases like \"commit\", \"clippy/fmt\", \"implement it\", \"update\".\n\nMost likely they would type something like:\n- \"push\" (after doing the amend themselves)\n- Or they might do the amend and push themselves without needing Claude\n\nActually, since they asked me to \"remind\" them, they're probably going to do the amend themselves. After that, the natural next step is to push. So they might type \"push\" after doing the amend.\n\nOr they might want me to do the amend for them. They might type something like \"do it\" or \"amend\" or \"go ahead\".\n\nGiven their terse style and that they just asked for a reminder, I think \"push\" is likely if they're about to do the amend themselves, or nothing if they're just going to do everything manually.\n\nBut wait - the suggestion should be what they would naturally type NEXT. If they're going to do the amend themselves, they wouldn't type anything to Claude for that. After doing it, they might type \"push\".\n\nI think \"push\" is a reasonable suggestion since that's the logical next step after the amend.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":404,"cache_read_input_tokens":39215,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":404},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkTkFLxLoaE7Uz962hon","type":"assistant","uuid":"2b35129b-5af6-418c-98e5-e5f6d1e8d4ec","timestamp":"2026-02-03T03:56:12.072Z"}
