They were implementing the CargoPassthrough trait, and they've been discussing it. We've established that it's working, code is clean.\n\nTheir pattern has been:\n- Implement something\n- Run clippy/fmt\n- Commit\n- Move on to next thing\n\nThe trait is implemented and working. Clippy/fmt passed. Looking at their workflow, they'd likely want to commit this work, or perhaps also convert the `install` command to use the trait to see how it looks with another example.\n\nGiven the conversation flow - we just finished implementing and verified it works - a natural next step would be to either:\n1. commit\n2. convert install to use the trait too\n\nLooking at their style, they're pretty concise. \"commit\" seems likely, but they might also want to see install converted first since we discussed multiple wrappers.\n\nActually, thinking more about it - they've been methodical. They created a branch for this work, documented it, then implemented it. The logical next step is probably to commit this working implementation before moving on.\n\nOr they might want to convert install to use the trait to really see the pattern work with multiple commands.\n\nI'll go with suggesting converting install since they asked about reducing boilerplate for multiple commands and seeing how they look together would validate the pattern better before committing.","signature":"EpEMCkYICxgCKkARrNqAAlAbIa0BJLQOsvMdrKy2I3YVLRe1p3oDWumSwqIqwRx8cCMh1txu1LIEpg9eNakDmIelmdoFZN8/0HjXEgxcmKUxgvw52zX0zXcaDHPVfmTCcdDr4K9OTiIwYc4IuLrPMSnbbvdzHj1HMOTpBzguNgcrBdA9poryjxZ9GA68hGMaEhprnuRBoumgKvgKIokRo7Xdg/dfbLG7FNG43fsbVqw5Kn+uy3WFhgOMgVMqFrqp1r1BMV4qObPLh+v4EJs7vL0JQ2EC9OMF4/TDwSAu9BXgJJSxaUp5N8Pp6X9RWEwzpRY6U0ZAw0diA2jU/WEpPozkohKd7iAGt5WSLxiZpoQFKXPnavq6qxadGEz9XxZ0TkZZudNEA/bEq7A251jpD04T1UF59daZnVwF1MuNl+pN+ISvlMrhgnEzPXcHV5v3FgeKSlJfxpz/Xkh0uXLy4UmvsNCxJvn9SCQHoeglzpVJGC1L9/VCH2ma4yfFcnFj/ezDKv+i6F1u6Tqo3rmQCH3E9vb/0scCv+doVPo0sqhpZvUnWUX2PQRvQAb7fb5a2r4XDbGh2fNU3DGVEBbDWkUgLdsghWUOL7rFBTwlGKqUfrxuJnm81Jlix9iUIWmTORAwN+yUXOIrJczjKX2VWE0Kovpt7Wzk2cXvvr4ZPZG4J5daAzjRqyBiSrBIYq2IBbDk3KLRu3ULJwg+qtM+DNDNOMNKRETXOlYaskmUrvvUdp5w+lBZIdvGsv09bEjX2jutn3YykQpdRiUUQ3fwb3fEJZGq5WkqU4l1Z0jC4e9vggaRRuRO3lgLX0F7koTN/Tv5Af2R/ETP53FPyuBuAKc+6+y1J6QhYJSq4iiLmImAoEOYSaUCM1tTomgXz6iNQQam1KKf8jByRcAxXTc0dMWRkWfJO23ygjOGfCME0uxBb9pAhypMPK/MtPeNI/3iNBP+a+xtk33M0lw600jQ6R3DpzbBj9apppLxu4atBm+pSWCLnSe/M0ucEVbjciXjn0ZfDgh9paxcEXuM9T4C3pNApjVv6oTNKNbRrBw3hbo0ncRsctK5LfX9TjHPIdJe1v0rP9OhS+kmh18WttZqZnNU7lJEN0dAic2T2H4Mw0EfNhpLPRDMuDyLAT1NULAKQi1dMcwC/uYPqCXeRJQWkPzoTOHns1HKMwNZKeTJ6F+/9JV65jAWi+s8yDWp6itQPLXcnh3FdgkqxFeZ4yaVcK31hewz2mVnyCEfSkuel/pTc8raoXHdi3fYBRL1uaVW12NFtUfmvZS+i6VG5NsEE+SAXK6mcjmvh0gSUVaecXs2goizM433qT13AEK7ZbXE3ozZPFcCci/BTzxCbxLc9deoIdVqifCPti04B9s0w9+2XeyCTxiHsTHoITUNU38IX1k9q89GMzN6Dn2nvAgIizOKLIzWxwiytsZopcVDru32d3fGjWtlgK3feQs1RYejk+eGaHJLflIVA5n8tUNF8C/48iewNRxrNSlBEHrMtK3tzOcI9oYmEdWQRxEJQ4kbrwoXgfN2gPkrlXbm0dMyGwULTKJikOB9KzJZDWWfLhi1C/V/qZtrYmZX10Kdq1B+yxkUshawnxLrGWKF3S0J/A+JrwmHOmgOrRcnkNGr7MS9MD6zKPTC3BydPxhUY71INYo19pozb4byUTtKzmYig/qeNpaZIUDPjcC4yzdyrU5Y2t/JcMWg0MupoOagVv5ZWNcGKydgFK0n3ps95CX9shu+lilfIPuO8BdkW/c7HPpFEdszZqLFM3+wmrW9c9XbcTcew4ueCSjnGPl+o7trc52ZAYvsxAb7/3X2BvVAXXRuH6IT+p1rl8eC+iDwYftV2vDiAsThfy0Q8EOW7POTfZzui5ixxM4zALeHK6R6teLM4AjbGnm0aynekrFi77hGh2bpFlQrMaji2s8s+PGFJbb+npgGpao4RDxa8zaPr2OxewwQ1gCkp2yMrhY/Um5wnSjc+VBzFAOzUJHQNI2wUX4f1HNYhxMg1vOJIjkFL17arYJ8lPiHnfq/RqRe9sFceTqdqfNbFIAHQAImCxiK6FJq39oYAQ=="}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":42148,"cache_read_input_tokens":17483,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":42148},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXkeDo5qTV6CwVttjE99u","type":"assistant","uuid":"41c4100a-f784-4925-a108-a8fff11a7d2b","timestamp":"2026-02-03T06:13:33.049Z"}
