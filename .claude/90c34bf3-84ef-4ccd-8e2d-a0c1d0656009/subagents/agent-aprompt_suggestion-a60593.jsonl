The user said the .claude files were already added and they'll commit themselves. So they're going to handle the git commit.\n\nAfter that commit is done, what would they naturally want to do next? The work on this feature is complete - they've added argument passthrough for the run command and bumped the version to 0.3.0.\n\nLooking at the conversation flow:\n1. User wanted to pass arguments to binaries via tspec run\n2. I implemented it\n3. User asked to commit\n4. I committed\n5. User asked to bump version and amend\n6. I bumped and tried to amend\n7. Some .claude files got included\n8. User said they'll commit themselves\n\nAfter they commit, what would be the natural next step? They might want to:\n- Push the changes\n- Test it again\n- Move on to something else\n\nBut since the user is handling the commit themselves, I should probably stay silent and let them finish and tell me what's next.
