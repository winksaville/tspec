User was looking at the CargoPassthrough trait design\n2. They asked to flatten the architecture by merging Commands::Clean and CleanCmd\n3. We implemented Option A successfully\n4. Tests, clippy, and fmt all pass\n\nThe user has been iterating on this feature. They might want to:\n1. Add another command (like ClippyCmd, FmtCmd) to test the pattern\n2. Commit the changes\n3. Test the clean command manually\n\nGiven that they're actively developing this feature and we just completed a significant refactor that works, the natural next step would be to either:\n- Test it out manually with `tspec clean`\n- Or commit the changes\n\nSince we already ran the tests, and this is a refactoring/design improvement, committing might be the natural next step. But they might also want to try it out first.\n\nLooking at their style - they use short commands like \"run test/clippy/fmt\". They're focused on making progress.\n\nI think \"commit\" or \"try tspec clean\" would be reasonable suggestions. Given they just verified tests pass, committing seems likely.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":28608,"cache_read_input_tokens":17483,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":28608},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmcv5tGJSQdD8j7z3wdZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"be0f3e9a-ecf7-45f4-acf7-8ef5d15cb570","timestamp":"2026-02-03T18:37:00.514Z"}
