They've been going through Build, Test, Run systematically. The remaining ones are Compare, Install, Ts, Version.\n\nLooking at the user's style - they've been giving short directives like \"Add BuildCmd\", \"commit\", \"y\", etc.\n\nThe natural next step would be to continue with converting another command. Given Install is a simple passthrough, that might be a good candidate. Or they might want to push the commit.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - the user's style is very terse. They say things like \"y\", \"commit\", \"Add BuildCmd\". Given the commit just happened, they might want to:\n1. Push the changes\n2. Continue with another command conversion\n3. Just see what's next\n\nI think the most likely is continuing with another command. \"convert Install\" or \"next command\" seems likely. Or they might want to see the state with \"what's left\".\n\nGiven their terse style, something like \"convert Install\" or just \"Install\" seems most likely if they want to continue.
