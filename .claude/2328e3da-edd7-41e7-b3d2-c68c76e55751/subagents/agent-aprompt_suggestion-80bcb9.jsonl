User just committed CLAUDE.md changes\n2. I reminded them about .claude/ session files\n3. User said \"commit the these changes I'll update .claude and then do the merge\"\n\nSo the user indicated they will:\n1. Update .claude files themselves\n2. Then do the merge\n\nThey'll likely come back after doing the merge and possibly ask something else. But right now, they're going to handle the .claude files and merge manually.\n\nGiven the conversation flow, after they do the merge they might want to continue working or clean up. But since they're about to do manual operations outside of Claude Code, I should stay silent and let them handle it.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - the pattern is they just finished a big chunk of work (the cargo-wrapper-trait branch) and are about to merge to main. After a merge, they might want to delete the feature branch or start on something new.\n\nBut since they're doing manual operations now (updating .claude and merging), I should stay silent and let them come back when ready.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":709,"cache_read_input_tokens":116548,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":709},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmjQ8XVcJp7as5Wjs1Lg","type":"assistant","uuid":"27b2fbdf-67af-4409-bc4b-abd4119f6267","timestamp":"2026-02-03T20:02:00.745Z"}
