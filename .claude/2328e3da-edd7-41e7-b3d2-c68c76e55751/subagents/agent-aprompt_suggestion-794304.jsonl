This is what they asked Claude to remind them about. They'll probably commit those files themselves since Claude explained earlier that it can't be done by Claude (circular reference issue).\n\nGiven that the user was working on the CargoPassthrough pattern and just finished committing CLAUDE.md, they might want to:\n1. Commit the .claude/ files themselves (manually)\n2. Continue with more refactoring (Build, Run commands)\n3. Something else\n\nBut actually, the user specifically said earlier \"please remind me every commit\" - so they're aware and will handle the .claude/ files themselves. The next natural step would be to continue the refactoring work - perhaps converting Build or Run to use the CargoPassthrough pattern.\n\nLooking at the conversation flow, they've done:\n- Clean command (already done before this session)\n- Test command (just finished)\n\nThe natural progression would be Build or Run command next.\n\nBut I'm not confident what they'd type next - they might want to take a break, or do something else. Let me stay silent since it's not obvious.\n\nActually, they might want to continue the pattern and convert more commands.
