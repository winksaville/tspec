But they might also want to see the current state or think about what's next.\n\nLooking at the earlier discussion, they talked about which commands could be passthroughs:\n- Clean ✓ (done)\n- Test ✓ (done)\n- Build - complex with specs\n- Run - complex with build + execute\n\nSince they've been systematically converting commands, they might want to continue with Build or Run. Or they might want to step back and look at the overall state.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern - they said \"refactor Commands::Test taking TestCmd that implements CargoPassthrough\" - so they might say something similar for Build or Run.\n\nOr they might be done for now and want to see the log or do something else.\n\nI think the most likely next thing would be to continue the pattern with Build or Run, since they're following a systematic approach.\n\nActually, I should be careful - earlier they noted that Build and Run have more complexity (specs, stripping, all-mode). But they converted Test which also had that complexity, so they might want to continue.\n\n\"refactor Commands::Build to BuildCmd\" or \"do the same for Build\" seems most natural given the pattern they've established.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2394,"cache_read_input_tokens":75970,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2394},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmgmA3Wad4dwx3nLuEXF","type":"assistant","uuid":"f40c8299-72ae-4f15-aa33-45e07aaa5589","timestamp":"2026-02-03T19:27:27.993Z"}
