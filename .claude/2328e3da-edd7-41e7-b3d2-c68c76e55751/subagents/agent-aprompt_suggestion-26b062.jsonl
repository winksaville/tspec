The natural follow-up after making a small code change like this would be to commit it. The user is clearly working on this branch and this is a refinement to the recent work.\n\nA commit would be the natural next step.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4963,"cache_read_input_tokens":22839,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4963},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmbXiEYHHGHQAWye1Zyb","type":"assistant","uuid":"acfd2675-a124-4f8b-bfd3-74520c083ebd","timestamp":"2026-02-03T18:18:46.232Z"}
