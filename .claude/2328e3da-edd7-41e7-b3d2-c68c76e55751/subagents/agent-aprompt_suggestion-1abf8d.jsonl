The user has been working on implementing ClippyCmd and FmtCmd, reorganizing code into cmd/ module\n2. They just committed the changes\n3. I reminded them about .claude/ session files\n4. They need to commit the .claude/ files\n\nThe natural next step would be for them to commit the .claude/ session files as I reminded them. But that's something they do themselves (I mentioned I can't do it due to circular reference).\n\nActually, looking at the flow - after commits they've been moving on to the next task or asking about something. The work seems complete for this feature branch. They might want to:\n- Merge to main\n- Create a PR\n- Continue with more work\n\nBut given they were just reminded about .claude/ files, they might just acknowledge or do that themselves outside of Claude.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern - after completing a significant chunk of work and committing, users often want to see a summary or move on. But I shouldn't suggest evaluative things.\n\nThis might be a case where silence is appropriate - let them assess what to do next (commit .claude files, or move on to other work).\n\nI'll stay silent since the next step isn't obvious from what they've been asking about - they might commit .claude/ files, might start a new task, might end the session.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2104,"cache_read_input_tokens":112186,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":2104},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXmj6nhuiEZa4AnAZg6mW","type":"assistant","uuid":"e9508573-3ae6-4e72-bb94-903f1e70ba74","timestamp":"2026-02-03T19:58:07.565Z"}
