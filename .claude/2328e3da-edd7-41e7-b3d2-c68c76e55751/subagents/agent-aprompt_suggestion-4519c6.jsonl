User is iterating on the trait name, doesn't like CargoPassthrough\n2. I suggested alternatives including `Cmd`\n3. User seems to be considering options\n\nGiven the user's concise style and the fact that they've been having a back-and-forth about naming, they might:\n- Pick one of the suggestions\n- Suggest their own name\n- Ask me to proceed with one\n\nGiven their style of short responses like \"y\", \"commit\", \"bump version\", they'd likely just pick one or make a counter-suggestion. Since `Cmd` seems like the natural fit (matches the struct naming pattern), they might just say to use it.\n\nBut I'm not sure they're ready to pick yet - they might have their own idea. Let me stay silent since it's not obvious what they'd say next.\n\nActually, looking at the pattern, they often respond with short confirmations or their preference. Since I offered options, they'd likely pick one. Given the struct naming pattern (*Cmd) and their terse style, they might say something like \"Cmd\" or \"use Cmd\" or just proceed with implementation.\n\nI'll suggest what seems natural based on the conversation - picking the Cmd suggestion since it was highlighted as matching their naming pattern.","signature":"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"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":10,"cache_creation_input_tokens":643,"cache_read_input_tokens":76692,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":643},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CXnY6BY3S1JnGRCxYS44K","type":"assistant","uuid":"f8cc8c1a-fd5d-4b33-bdae-6adc90f36df6","timestamp":"2026-02-04T06:14:19.581Z"}
